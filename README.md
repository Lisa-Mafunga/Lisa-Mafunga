<h2>⚡ About Me</h2>
<p>I’m an aspiring frontend developer and a dedicated student with a passion for creating engaging web experiences. Through programs like Africa Agility and Women in Techsters, I’ve gained hands-on experience in frontend development and collaboration. I’m currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m eager to take on new challenges. I believe in continuous learning and the power of community in tech.</p>


<h2>👨‍💻 Frontend Development Projects:</h2>

<p><b> 🔭 PSYCFLO</b>  <br> <br> PSYCFLO is more than just a project — it’s a mission. It’s a mental health assistant platform combined with a menstrual poverty alleviation initiative, designed to support mental well-being while providing menstrual pads to those who need them most. This project allowed me to apply my frontend skills in a collaborative environment, focusing on user experience and responsive design.</p>
